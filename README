package.  There is also a file init-ipsur.el which is used to
initialize Emacs for publishing in a predictable manner.  The include
directory contains assorted LaTeX files for the preamble and
frontmatter, plus an R file which sets up the R environment and loads
the R contributed package dependencies.
